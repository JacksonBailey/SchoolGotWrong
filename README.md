# SchoolGotWrong

This is the html code for the website 'yourschoolgotwrong.com', a small coding project I did trying to make a website that tells you, year by year, what your school got wrong in teaching you. There isn't much to it, just some basic HTML and JavaScript.

As for guidelines with this being an open source webpage, here's the following to keep in mind -
# How to Contribute
Step 1. Please open an Issue with a description of what you're trying to add/fix/change. Can be anything, but no guarantees it'll get approved.
Step 2. Fork and create a feature branch in the format <some-description>/<your issue number>
Step 3. Please squash all your commits into one with a good commit message before opening a pull request
Step 4. Open a pull request, reference your original issue, and provide a concise description of how your changes fixed the issue
Step 5. Your PR requires 1 approval from myself before it can be merged.

I'm open to feedback on improving the code, the open source, just about anything - I'm an *extremely* new programmer, so want to learn the best practices as early as I can.

Thanks!
