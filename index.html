<h1><p style="color:white;">What Did Your School Get Wrong?</p></h1>
<br>
<p style="font-family:arial; font-size:15px; color:white;">American Schools get a lot of things wrong. Sure, it's easy to make a few minor mistakes, but once we get into<br>
more complex topics, a lot of errors in what schools teach get revealed. It's troubling to say the<br>
least - how do sort out what's true and what's false? That's what this website is for - figuring out<br>
just what your school got wrong. All you have to do is enter the decade you graduated in, and read along!<br>
