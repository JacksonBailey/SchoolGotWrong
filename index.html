        What Did Your School Get Wrong?
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:white;">
        American Schools get a lot of things wrong. Sure, it's
        easy to make a few minor mistakes, but once we get into<br>
        more complex topics, a lot of errors in what schools teach get revealed. It's troubling to say the<br>
        least - how do sort out what's true and what's false? That's what this website is for - figuring out<br>
        just what your school got wrong. All you have to do is enter the decade you graduated in, and read
        along!<br><br>
